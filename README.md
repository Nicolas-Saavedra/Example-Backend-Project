# Example Backend Web Project

The following Project is a mock-up of a university web backend for their management site. This project's contents will be updated continuously.

This README file will be updated continuously during this project's lifetime, and it shall show the execution of an example project, as well as a testing ground for my backend abilities to grow with tools that are less opinionated, and hence, more applicable on external projects that use different tools.

The frontend side for this project is a possibility, however, it's unclear whether a frontend will be developed at all.
